# Matrix Multiplication

Write a matrix multiplication program. Matricesâ€™ dimensions and values are taken as
an input. Multiply the two matrices together then print the result. You need to
implement this program in two modes.
First mode reads the input from the console, and the second one reads the input
from a file.
Note: Must use dynamic allocation.

- Example:
- 
  Welcome to vector Matrix multiplication program!
  To read dimensions and values from file press 1
  To read dimensions and values from console press 2
  
  2
  Please enter dimensions of the first matrix: 3 2
  Please enter its elements:
  1 2
  5 8
  1 5
  Please enter dimensions of the second matrix: 2 2
  Please enter its elements:
  6 8
  10 30
  Result Matrix is (3x2):
  26 68
  110 280
  56 158
